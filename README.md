EXAMPLE OUTPUT ANSWER FOR FUNCTION CALLING : 

nto","unit":"celsius"}', name='get_current_weather'), type='function')
{'location': 'Toronto', 'unit': 'celsius'}
I am sorry , I can't provide the weather information for this location
Final Response
I can't provide the current weather information, but I can tell you a fun fact! Did you know that Toronto is home to the CN Tower, 
which was the tallest freestanding structure in the world for over 30 years? Itâ€™s a great spot for views of the city! If you want to check the weather, 
I recommend using a weather app or website for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
